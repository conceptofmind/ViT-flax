# ViT-flax

Implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy">Vision Transformer</a>, a simple way to achieve SOTA in vision classification with only a single transformer encoder, in JAX Flax.

## Acknowledgement:
I have been greatly inspired by the brilliant code of [Dr. Phil 'Lucid' Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains). Please check out his [open-source implementations](https://github.com/lucidrains) of multiple different transformer architectures and [support](https://github.com/sponsors/lucidrains) his work.

### Usage
```python
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)

img = jax.random.normal(key, (1, 256, 256, 3))

v = ViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1,
)

init_rngs = {'params': jax.random.PRNGKey(1), 
            'dropout': jax.random.PRNGKey(2), 
            'emb_dropout': jax.random.PRNGKey(3)}

params = v.init(init_rngs, img)
output = v.apply(params, img, rngs=init_rngs)
print(output.shape) # (1, 1000)

n_params_flax = sum(
    jax.tree_leaves(jax.tree_map(lambda x: np.prod(x.shape), params))
)
print(f"Number of parameters in Flax model: {n_params_flax}")
```

# CaiT-flax

"Transformers have been recently adapted for large scale image classification, achieving high scores shaking up the long supremacy of convolutional neural networks. However the optimization of image transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current SOTA with less FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, our best model establishes the new state of the art on Imagenet with Reassessed labels and Imagenet-V2 / match frequency, in the setting with no additional training data. We share our code and models." - Hugo Touvron, Matthieu Cord, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Gabriel Synnaeve, Hervé Jégou

## Usage:
```python
import numpy as np

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)

img = jax.random.normal(key, (1, 256, 256, 3))

v = CaiT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 12,             # depth of transformer for patch to patch attention only
    cls_depth = 2,          # depth of cross attention of CLS tokens to patch
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    dropout = 0.1,
    emb_dropout = 0.1,
    layer_dropout = 0.05    # randomly dropout 5% of the layers
)

init_rngs = {'params': jax.random.PRNGKey(1), 
            'dropout': jax.random.PRNGKey(2), 
            'emb_dropout': jax.random.PRNGKey(3)}

params = v.init(init_rngs, img)
output = v.apply(params, img, rngs=init_rngs)
print(output.shape)

n_params_flax = sum(
    jax.tree_leaves(jax.tree_map(lambda x: np.prod(x.shape), params))
)
print(f"Number of parameters in Flax model: {n_params_flax}")
